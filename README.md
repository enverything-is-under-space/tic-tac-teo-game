There is a flowchart pdf file may help you for know what's going on (maybe a little details isn't included)

- File main.cxx is complete version

- File main-with-translate-cell-ids.cxx is an old version, a function were push number between 0 to 2 (index array X,Y,Z) to depend queue for calculate move computer player then in file main.cxx it's fixed and function translate removed because there is no reason to call a function nearby 9 times when we can do better without that function.
