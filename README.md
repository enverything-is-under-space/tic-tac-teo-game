Tic Tac Teo with simple A.I

There is a flowchart pdf file may help for know what's going on (maybe a little details not include)

- main.cxx is complete version
- main-with-translate-cell-ids.cxx is an old version, computer were push number between 0 to 2 (index array X,Y,Z) to depend queue for calculate move then in main.cxx it's fixed and function translate removed because there is no reason to call a function nearby 9x when we can do better without that function.
